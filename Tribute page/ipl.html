            Captaincy:
            Virat Kohli has been the captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore since 2013. Under his leadership, the
            team
            has experienced both highs and lows, reaching the IPL final in 2016. Despite not clinching the title,
            Kohli's
            captaincy has been marked by strategic acumen and a never-give-up attitude.</p>

        <p>
            Batting Records:
            Kohli has consistently been one of the leading run-scorers in the IPL. His ability to chase down targets and
            build innings has made him a mainstay in the RCB lineup. He holds several records in the tournament,
            including
            the most runs in a single IPL season.</p>

        <p>
            Achievements
            While RCB has not secured an IPL title during Kohli's captaincy, the team has produced memorable
            performances.
            Kohli himself has been exceptional, winning multiple awards for his batting performances and leadership
            skills.</p>

        <p>
            Loyalty to RCB:
            Virat Kohli's loyalty to RCB is noteworthy. He has been associated with the franchise since the inception of
            the
            IPL in 2008. Despite the team's ups and downs, Kohli has remained committed to the Bangalore-based
            franchise.</p>

        <p>
            Impact on and off the Field
            Kohli's presence in the IPL extends beyond his on-field exploits. His passionate and aggressive style of
            play,
            combined with his vocal leadership, has made him one of the most influential figures in the league. Off the
            field, he is actively involved in team promotions and engages with fans through social media.</p>

        <p>
            2021 IPL Season:
            In the IPL 2021 season, which was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kohli continued to lead RCB.
            Although
            the tournament faced challenges, Kohli's performances and captaincy remained in the spotlight.</p>
